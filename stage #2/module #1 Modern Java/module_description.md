# Modern Java

Java does not stand at the same place and is constantly being updated. With new releases, new features are added, and existing approaches are improved.
In this module, we decided to consider the most important changes that have occurred in Java, starting with JDK 8 and ending with JDK 16.

## Functional Way of Java
So far Java was supporting the imperative style of programming and object-oriented style of programming. The big thing what java has been added is that Java has started supporting the functional style of programming with its Java 8 release. In this lesson, we will discuss functional programming in Java 8.

We will cover functional interfaces, lambda expressions, functional composition, method references, stream API and Optional.

## Structuring and encapsulation

In this lesson, we will look at Java from a structuring and encapsulation perspective. We will examine in detail the topic of modularity and packaging, consider hidden classes, and pay attention to a new type of Java class - Record. In addition, we'll cover the Sealed Classes theme. 

## Old services reborn

In addition to adding new features, Java also updates existing classes, services and approaches.

In this lesson, we'll go deep into the new Date and Time API which resolve the long-standing issues of existing APIs: java.util.Date and Java.util.Calendar, and also consider the new versions of the HTTP Client.

# Slight Code writing improvements

Here we take a look at some code writing improvments.  First, we'll look at Local-Variable Type Inference and LocalVariable Syntax for Lambda Parameters, then we'll pay attention to a new approach to writing Switch Expressions. Next, we'll examine Text Blocks and end up learning Pattern Matching for instanceof.
