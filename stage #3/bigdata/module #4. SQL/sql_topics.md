## Task 1 (theoretic task)

Transaction table `t` is given:

| record_type | tr_date    | tr_id | amount | cust_id |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----: | -----: | ------: |
| HEADER      | 2018-01-01 | 1     |   5	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-01 | 1     |   2	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-02 | 1     |   1	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-03 | 1     |   2	| 2       |
| HEADER      | 2018-01-02 | 1     | -12	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2019-03-27 | 2     |  22	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2019-03-26 | 2     |  11	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2019-03-28 | 2     |   7	| 2       |
| HEADER      | 2019-03-27 | 2     |  40	| 2       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-01 | 3     |   2	| 3       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-02 | 3     |   1	| 3       |
| ITEM        | 2018-01-03 | 3     |   2	| 3       |

Complete the following tasks:
1) Select records with the top 3 _amount_ for each customer's(_cust_id_) transaction (_tr_id_) 
2) Select all "HEADER" transactions, in addition, for each transaction calculate the number of days that have passed since the previous transaction of the same customer (let's say there's a function *days_between(one_date, second_date)*)
3) Calculate cumulative sum (sum of the transaction amount from the beginning to the current moment(_tr_date_)) and the total sum for each customer's(_cust_id_) transaction (_tr_id_). Output schema example: " *, tr_cum_sum, total_sum "
4) Select transaction data without duplicates by _record_type_, _tr_id_ and _amount_ for each customer. In several ways
