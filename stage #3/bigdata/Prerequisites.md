# Prerequisites 

## Common rules and requirements
- Source code must be under VCS (git).
- [GitHub](https://github.com) can be used as git-repository hosting service.
- Source code must be in a private repository.
- All tasks should be located in the same repository, repository itself should be named using the
 pattern *"{Name}_{Surname}_BigDataLab"*.
- Each task should be located in the separate folder named *"Task{X}"*.
 In case the task depends on/extends previous one, source code can be copied into current task folder.
- Invite your mentors as collaborators to the repository.
- It is forbidden to add any other members to your project except this was additionally requested by mentors.
- Result of your work (commits) should appear every few days (ideally — every day).
- Source code should be clean and should not contain any "developer-purpose" constructions.
- Only *master* branch source code taken into account while checking any of the tasks (please
  notify the mentors once you've merged your task).
- Git workflow for main tasks:

## Task review
After each task deadline you'll be assigned to the online session with one or several mentors to
present your task and answer the implementation-specific/theoretical questions.
- Presentation is performed using shared desktop.
- Only *master* branch should be used.
- Ensure that the task is working as described in the task.
- Prepare short description of your program architecture.
- Ensure that you're able to explain why you're using some specific constructions/technologies.
- **Answers like "I just copied this from tutorial" are not applicable** — if you're using something
 ensure that you're understand this.

## Other rules:
- Feel free to propose to use some additional (unmentioned) tools/frameworks/libs, in this case 
approval from the mentors required.
- JDK: Oracle JDK 8 or higher (use Java 8 features like new date time API, lambdas and streams, optional where possible).
- Public APIs must be documented (Javadoc).
- Questions are normal and show the process of your study, do not hesitate to ask, especially
those related to the task description/understanding.
