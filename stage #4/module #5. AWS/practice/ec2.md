# Amazon EC2

## Practice

As part of this module, you'll work with the following resources: 
1. EC2 instances
2. Security Groups

IMPORTANT: do not forget to remove all the created resources after the task has been completed.

### Amazon Web Services

1. Create a Linux EC2 instance(a free-tier eligible AMI will be enough)
2. Create and configure a Security Group for the instance so that: <br />
2.1. It allows access over HTTP and HTTPS from anywhere <br />
2.2. It allows access over SSH only from your IP address <br />
3. Install an HTTP server on your instance.
4. Download the simple static website from the previous S3 module on your instance.
5. Make sure you can view your website by accessing your instance over HTTP.

### LocalStack

Unfortunately, there are no tasks to do in LocalStack in this module.
