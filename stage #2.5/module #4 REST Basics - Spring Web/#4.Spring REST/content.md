## REST with Spring

### Understanding REST in Spring

The Spring framework supports two ways of creating RESTful services:
- using MVC with ModelAndView;
- using HTTP message converters.<br>

The **ModelAndView approach** is older and much better documented, but also more verbose and configuration heavy. 
The new approach, based on **HttpMessageConverter and annotations**, is much more lightweight and easy to implement.
Configuration is minimal, and it provides sensible defaults for what you would expect from a RESTful service.

Let's consider how to build REST application using Spring Web framework step by step.
