**HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)** is a constraint of the REST application architecture. 
A hypermedia driven REST API provides information to help to navigate through the API dynamically. 
This is done by passing hypermedia links with the responses. **HATEOAS** is a fundamental concept to create Discoverable REST APIs.

The Spring framework provides the `HATEOAS library` that you can use to easily create REST representations that follow the principle of **HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State)**.
