# Big Data Mentoring Program

### Intro
This mentoring program was designed to give a basic undestanding of skills required in Data Practice
and should help interested students to reduce the knowledge gap for further BigData trainings.

### Duration
The desired duration of mentoring course in Java Lab is ~ **5-6 weeks**.
The course was designed as a short-term one to allow students to be able to continue their careers as web developers in case of any obstacles.

### Requirements
Students are expected to be well-prepared for every theoretical session, complete all practical tasks on time 
and show strong motivation regarding BigData.

### Course flow

The course is split into two parts which go independently, each part is covered by a separate mentors group

### Theoretical sessions 
Online meetings twice a week.
The sessions are not lectures, they should be considered as a knowledge check/recap activity 
combined with the answers on any tricky questions as well as with explanation of the 'special attention' subtopics.

### Practical tasks 
Online meeting for each student after each task deadline.
Practical tasks are designed to let the student get familiar with the 'concept' of the standard tasks in BigData world 
and follow submit-implement-deadline-review lifecycle. 

### Further prospects
This mentoring program is a preparatory stage for **201 Big Data Mentoring program** (handled on EPAM Learn Platform)
which is the official basic training program for Big Data discipline. 
Includes practical home tasks, intermediate and final screenings.
 
It requires minimum **6,5 weeks** of full effort under mentorship of Big Data experts.
