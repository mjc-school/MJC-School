Suppose we are backend service of the large book store. 
We have been asked to calculate statistics about the most popular books this year. 
We get the list of sold books and the required size of the top list. Result Order does not matter

Example:
input: ["a", "b", "a", "c", "b", "b"], top 2 
result: ["a", "b"]
