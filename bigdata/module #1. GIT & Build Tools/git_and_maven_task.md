#### Task
1. Install Maven
2. Assemble custom jar `utils-1.3.5.jar`.
    It should be compatible with java 8. 
    The manifest file should contain the name and version of your jar.
    The jar should contain class `StringUtils` with method `boolean isPositiveNumber(String str)`.
    Use `Apache Commons Lang 3.10` library to implement this method.
    Write one any unit test for your `StringUtils.isPositiveNumber(String str)` using `JUnit 4.12`.
3. Create a project `multi-project` with two subprojects `core` and `api`.
    The `core` subproject should contain class `Utils` with method `boolean isAllPositiveNumbers(String... str)`.
    Use `utils-1.3.5.jar` from the previous task to implement this method.
    The `api` subproject should contain class `App` with the `main` method.
    Call `Utils.isAllPositiveNumbers("12", "79")` from the `main` method of `api` subproject.
