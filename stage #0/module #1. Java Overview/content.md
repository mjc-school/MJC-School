## The main features of the Java language

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. This language was originally
called Oak and was developed for consumer devices, but in the course of development, it became used in web applications
due to its security and cross-platforming features. Java is actively supported and as of today, it is already version

18.

### Main Features of Java:

- Object-oriented programming.
- Simplicity.
- Security. Can't access memory directly.
- Cross-platform. Can be run on any platform where the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) is installed.
- Automatic garbage collection. The memory does not need to be explicitly cleared.

**As Java has evolved, many features have been added. You may not understand these concepts now, but definitely will
have to come back later. Here are some of them:**

Java 5:

- Generics
- Annotations
- Autoboxing/unboxing
- Enumerations
- Varargs
- Enhanced for each loop
- Static imports
- New concurrency utilities in java.util.concurrent
- Scanner class for parsing data from various input streams and buffers

Java 8:

- Lambda expression support in APIs
- Stream API
- Functional interface and default methods
- Optionals
- Annotation on Java Types
- Unsigned Integer Arithmetic
- Repeating annotations
- New Date and Time API
- Remove the permanent generation from GC

Java 9:

- Java platform module system
- Interface Private Methods
- HTTP 2 Client
- JShell â€“ REPL Tool
- Platform and JVM Logging

## How the code is compiled and why cross-platforming is needed in Java

In some programming languages, code is compiled into native code for a specific architecture. And if we run such code in
another platform, with a different architecture (processor, operating system), then most likely, this code will not
work.
The C programming language compiler works in a similar way. The code written by a programmer is compiled into native
code,
understandable by the specific architecture in which it is written.

The Java language was originally made with the goal of writing once, running anywhere.
Therefore, after writing a program, Java code is compiled into bytecode. The bytecode looks the same regardless of the
platform because only the **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) needs this code. The JVM, in turn, interprets the bytecode into
native code that is
understandable for a specific system. This is called **cross-platforming**.

**Consider an example:**

Imagine we have written a program in Java and want to submit it to a tester for testing. The tester has a different
operating system installed than ours. To run such a program in C, he would have to compile your code for his system.
But since Java is platform-independent, the tester, having the JRE installed, can launch your Java application for
testing, without having to recompile it again.

1. Dev writes Java code in its own IDE.
2. Dev then compiles this code into bytecode using the utility.
    - Manually by using **javac** (Java compiler) utility
    - Automatically compiling in IDE or building tools like **Maven** or **Gradle**
3. Dev builds a **JAR** (Java ARchive) file.
    - Manually by using the **jar cvf** command
    - Automatically building using build tools like Maven or Gradle
4. Then the dev passes this file to the tester.
5. The tester, in turn, having the JRE installed, launches the JAR file.
6. After that, a new instance of the JVM is launched, which reads all the bytecode classes from the JAR, translates them
   into native code, and executes.
7. Tester can use the program.

Java compiler or **javac** is included as a batch utility in JDK and is located in /jdk/bin/javac. When you run programs
in development environments, the code is compiled automatically.
