# How To Contribute?

## Contribution options
MJC School provides several options for Java engineers to contribute to the school:
+ Mentor (and co-Mentor)
+ Group Coordinator
+ Run Coordinator
+ Content Creator

## Mentor
What it takes to be a mentor? To be a mentor is a great responsibility and even more great opportunity to improve your soft skills, gain or review new technologies, boost your code review skills, and get new friends.

We expect mentor to work with at least one mentee (several mentees at the same time is also an option) and be a middle software engineer with 1.5-2+ years of production experience at least.
Exceptions are possible, so if you would like to give a try - reach out to us.

Co-mentor is an option for those who has no experience in mentorship or onboarding and who would like to learn from experienced colleagues.

## Group Coordinator
This option for these engineers who are experienced mentors and would like to get experience in coordination activities. This position is pretty similar to Scrum Master or Team Lead - you're expected to work with the group of mentor-mentee pairs, help them organize the process, track the progress, collect feedbacks, etc.

We expect Group Coordinator to be a mature software engineer (preferably Senior, but we do not have strict rules) with a mentorship experience.

## Run Coordinator
This option for these engineers who are looking to be a Scrum Master/Dev Lead/Team Lead and get experience in coordination, stuffing activities, program development.

We expect Run Coordinator to be a mature software engineer (preferably Senior, but we do not have strict rules) with a group coordination experience.

## Content Creator
This role is for those who want to influence industry standards for Java engineers.
Since our program has so many stages, we have various expectations to contributors depending on the stage:
* Stage 0 - Juniors with some production experience are welcome to join, as well as more mature colleagues to help with impediments, review and coordination
* Stage 1 and Stage 2 - Middle engineers are welcome to join, as well as more mature colleagues to help with impediments, review and coordination
* Stage 3 - Middle engineers with 2+ years or Seniors are welcome to join, as well as more mature colleagues to help with impediments, review and coordination

For each content creators group we do organize a kick-off session to provide some information on the module and answer any questions.
