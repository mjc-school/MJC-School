## Java Collection Tasks

## List
1. Write a method to iterate through all elements in an ArrayList containing the days of the week (strings). The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to insert a string "MJC" into the ArrayList at the third (counting from 1) and last positions. The ArrayList should initially contain "String1", "String2", "String3". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to copy one ArrayList into another (copy list2 into list1). The first List should contain "1", "2", "3", "4". The second List should contain "A", "B", "C", "D". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list1, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to iterate a LinkedList containing the days of the week (strings) in reverse order. The method should return a string containing the elements of the list in reverse order, separated by a space.
5. Write a method that adds 1 000 000 elements to ArrayList and LinkedList then gets a random element from the filled lists by index 1 000 times. Measure the time spent. Compare the results and return 1 if the time spent for ArrayList is greater, -1 if less, 0 if equal.

## Set
1. Write a method to iterate through all elements in a HashSet containing the days of the week (strings). The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to clone a HashSet to another HashSet. The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to compare two sets and retain elements that are the same on both sets.First HashSet should contain "Red", "Green","Black", "White" elements, second HashSet should contain "Red", "Pink", "Black", "Orange" elements.  The method should return a string containing the elements of the first set, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to create a new TreeSet, add all the days of the week (string). The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.
5. Write a method to find the numbers less than 10 in a new TreeSet. The method should return a string containing the elements of the set, separated by a space.

## Queue
1. Write a Java program to create a new priority queue, add all the days of the week (string), iterate through elements and return a String object which contains days of the week.
2. Write a Java program to add all the elements of a priority queue to another priority queue.
3. Write a Java program to convert a priority queue to an array containing all of the elements of the queue.

## Map
1. Write a method to test if a Map<Integer, String> contains a key for the specified value. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to get a collection view of the values contained in the Map<Integer, String>. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing "Collection view is: " and the elements of the map, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to get a set view of the keys contained in the Map<Integer, String>. Values should contain the days of the week. The method should return a string containing "Key set values are: " and the elements of the map, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to sort keys in a TreeMap<String, Integer> by the length of the key (DESC). Keys should contain "Red", "Green", "Orange", "Pink" colors. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map in reverse order, separated by a space.
5. Write a method that takes a Map <Integer, String> as input and returns a Map where the keys and values are swapped. The method should return a string containing the elements of the map, separated by a space.

## Combined
1. Write a Java program that takes an array of String elements as an input and returns Map <String, Integer>, where String is the value from the array and Integer is the number of entries in the array.
2. Write an Iterator over an array.
3. Write a Java program to build a frequency dictionary of the letters of the English alphabet.
